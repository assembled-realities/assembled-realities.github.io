THE PLATFORMER
====================
Description
Your lives seemed simple. Everything was just Going Right. It all went with The Program. 
You Jump High. Fruit floats off the ground. Barrels get Thrown. Or something like that. 
It all made sense. Then one day, you went...off, under, through(?!) the stage-select map. 
Now, everything else has gone sideways (or at least Left!), but not you. 
You are the Hammer surrounded by Barrels, the ones for smashing. Right? Always Right.

// This playbook is about bringing certain rules from your World of origin with you on your journeys.
// It's also about starting off single-minded and narrowly defined.
// The mechanics in The Platformer's moves are very much an assertion that all Worlds
// and all circumstances you encounter in them will meet your personal expectations;
// punctuated with an insistent foot stamp.
// We'll just see how long the “concrete” holds up under all that stamping, Right?

Character Questions
- What arbitrary criteria does your Platformer use to determine the level of success of a mission?
