THE MAKESHIFT
====================
Description
Some folk wiggle their fingers in the air and something shiny and wonderous happens.
Not you, you dig in up to your elbows and find the right tool for the situation.
And if you don't? The parts to make one will suffice. Don't be surprised when 
someone tells you to put that thing back where it came from, though...

// The Makeshift is all about getting the most out of your surroundings, 
// even if that means leaving a trail of debris. 
// Your moves focus on producing mechanically significant items or effects 
// out of improvised or found materials - that may or may not belong
// right where they are - thank you very much.

Character Questions
- What circumstances first drove your Makeshift towards ad hoc problem solving? 
- What's something your Makeshift regrets breaking to get the upper hand in a tense situation?
- What is the one tool or material your Makeshift stumbles without?

====================
Link Move: * Follow The Instructions *

When one of you issues step-by-step directions to the other, they can spend that Hold 
to give Advantage to the next Roll that follows those directions.
====================
Playbook Moves (At character creation, take "Take What You Can" and choose 2)

* Take What You Can *
When you ransack your surroundings to find, build, or modify a constructed object, 
Roll with Mastery:
On a Hit, Describe the object, how it fulfills the function you intend for it (if that isn't obvious),
and choose 1 option below. On a 10+, Choose 2 more options.
- The Object grants +1 ongoing to one Basic Move (choose which one now)
- The Object or it's components won't be missed.
- The Object is inconspicuous.
- The Object produces no unintended effects.
- The Object is of high quality or usefulness.

* Give Nothing Back *
When you can't (or won't) relinquish something you took to get out of trouble, Mark Experience.

* Now, it's Real Simple *
When you rely on impenetrable jargon, technobabble, or rapid-fire detailed instructions,
you may Roll with Mastery instead of Heart to Convince Someone.
On a 10+, they are astonished by your expertise and gain a Mastery Link with you. 
If they already have a Mastery Link with you, Lock that Link.

* Master Builder *
While you are assembling, dismantling, repairing, altering, operating, or hands-on investigating
a complex constructed object, you count as a Small Gang and can do more than a normal person.

* Catch a Ride! *
When you or someone you have a Link with operate a mode of transportation, you may Spend a Link to:
- Declare the person whose Link you Spent is a passenger, if they are willing.
- Declare you are a passenger, if the person whose Link you Spent is willing.

* Cunning but Brutal *
When you set a trap or sabotage a constructed object, Roll to Interfere using Mastery instead of Dark. 
Resolve the outcome of your roll on the first person affected by your trap or sabotage.

* First Try! *
You may gain Advantage on a roll as if you Spent a Link by describing how you Lose Something Important.

* But It's Going to Look Really Cool *
You may create a small scale retcon as if you Spent a Link if you cause meaningful collateral damage
in the retcon.
====================
After 3 Advancements, you may take this Move or other Advanced Moves
* Red Ones Go Faster *
When you take this Move, describe a purely aesthetic quirk and a specific functional purpose.
When you are in a scene, constructed objects with that quirk grant +1 ongoing to be used for that purpose.
