Playbook Moves (At character creation, take "So Many Cooks" and choose 2)

*Fish in a Barrel, More in the Sea*
When you Defend yourself From Harm, you get -1 to the Roll.
When you take Harm, describe how your Ensemble dwindles without depleting.
You may Spend Experience instead of taking Harm.
If this would leave you with less than 0 Experience, lose a Move.

*So Many Cooks*
When you contribute to the ease or difficulty of a particular task, roll with Links.
The GM chooses which Links to roll based on the situation.

On a 10+, you count as a Small Gang until you resolve your next Move.
On a Hit, choose 1 option to apply to the next roll to accomplish the task.
On a Miss, the GM chooses instead.
- Change a miss into a 7-9; or a 7-9 into a 10. If the roll was already a 10+, you mark Experience.
- Change a 10 into a 7-9; or a 7-9 into a miss. If the roll was already a miss, you mark Experience.

*We've Been Busy*
When you spend an appreciable amount of time "off screen" or "out of the spotlight", 
describe generally what you were doing during the interval and roll with Links.
The GM chooses which Links to roll based on the description of your actions.

On a 7-9, choose 1 option. On a 10+, choose 2.
- You make, find, or take something valuable. 
- You discover the answer to a question.
- You set up a significant opportunity.
- You avoid unwanted attention.
On a miss, introduce a dangerous situation right away.

*Roger, Roger*
When you believe you are following instructions someone has given you, 
you count as a Small Gang and can do more than a normal person.

*BA-NA-NA!!*
When your attention is wrapped up in routine or frivolous pursuits, 
you count as a Small Gang and can do more than a normal person.

*Assistant (to the) Manager*
When someone singles out one member of your Ensemble to interact with,
decide whether they exert their individuality from the Ensemble.
If they do, name them if you haven't already and roll with Mastery.

On a 7-9, they become an independent NPC with a Mastery Link with you. 
The GM gives them 2 more Links.
On a 10+, you get to give them 2 Links instead. They don't need to be Links you hold. 

*Huddle Up*
When disagreement or indecision among the members of your Ensemble make you miss an opportunity, mark Experience.

*Meddlesome*
FitD Resist or Old Familiar World Intervene
INTERVENE (-2 if Guilty, Anxious)
When you directly intercept, redirect, or oppose something that is happening or about to happen, roll with the questions:
- Are you prepared for this intervention?
- Are you focused on the part of the situation you want to change?
- Are you intervening in someone else using one of your Moves?

On a Miss, you Mark a Mood and the situation escalates.

On a Hit, you are tied up in the situation and must STRIVE to get out. On a 7-9, choose 1. On a 10+, choose 2.
- You resist or avoid being tied up in the situation and do NOT need to STRIVE to get out.
- You oppose someone else’s efforts. An NPC is stopped. A PC must STRIVE to overcome your opposition.
- You implore someone to reconsider their efforts. An NPC chooses to stop. A PC Earns a Merit and does not succeed.
- You de-escalate the situation
- You prevent or mitigate immediate distress

- You take control of the situation

- You seize the attention of others in the situation
- You impress, surprise, or frighten someone

- You take something from them

- You create an opportunity
- You improve someone else’s position or outcome

The more specific options in the list, the more fictional vectors for the GM to say “you DIDN’T choose to…” but a 10+ should still feel like a complete success….
Perhaps a list on the longer side, but 10+ is Choose 3, instead of Choose 2, and maybe 7-9 is Choose 2? Or still Choose 1?


*From the Wings*
When you spend a Link, you may Interfere with, Limit Break, or Defend someone From Harm
as though you were in the scene with them.

On a Hit, you appear in the scene and act.
On a 7-9, you lose track of something important.
On a Miss, the consequences of the Move are felt in both locations.
====================
After 3 Advancements, you may take this Move or another Advanced Move
*Jolly Cooperation*
When you act collectively with your friends to do something impossible, describe your goal.
The GM says what you must do to achieve it. 
Roll plus the number of friends who agree to risk taking Harm in the attempt.

On a Hit, you do it and set up an unbelievable opportunity.
On a 7-9, everyone who agreed to risk Harm takes Harm.
On a Miss, everyone takes Harm and prepare for the absolute worst.

You may take additional Harm to increase the result of this roll by the amount of Harm you took this way.
