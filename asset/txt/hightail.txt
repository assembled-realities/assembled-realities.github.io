THE HIGHTAIL
====================
Description
Wanderlust is hardly a rare sentiment, but there are those who manage to find boundaries 
they just can't push past with distance or novelty. The World is wrapped in a safety blanket 
keeping all the comfy status quo in. There must be a Way Out! Sure enough, you found it! 
You failed to leave this World once before and have become tangled in the fabric of It 
in a way that sets you apart from everybody else. You're caught in the weave, but maybe 
that means a tug in the right place will unravel everything standing in your way!

// The Hightail changes their Experience Track into a lit fuse and opens up a box of matches. 
// You will be able to directly affect the pace at which you gain Experience and approach the 
// climax of your character's story. You are going to progress quickly and you are going to be
// able to push this game's Basic Moveset harder than the rest of your party. 
// What's the tradeoff? Well, what's at the end of a fuse?


Character Questions
- Your efforts to escape already revealed a surefire Way Out of this World. What was it?
- What Obstacle stopped your last attempt in its tracks?
- What Snags keep you from trying again?
- What about your look communicates that you're struggling against a fundamental aspect of this reality, that you nearly broke free once, and that neither you nor the World came away with a total victory?

====================
Playbook Moves (At character creation, take "I'm Going Nowhere" and nothing else)

* I'm Going Nowhere *
You cannot leave this World except by Making Your Escape through a Way Out. 
If you pursue a different Way Out than the one described in your backstory answers, 
work with the GM to establish a major Obstacle and minor Snags to complicate 
a new route for Making Your Escape.

When you would mark Harm, weather the blow and mark Experience instead. 
Describe how more of you becomes tangled in, or unraveled from, reality.

When you fill your Experience Track, don't Advance as normal. 
Describe how your struggle with the fabric of reality becomes more noticeable.

If you have fewer than 5 moves from this playbook, 
pick a move from this playbook and clear your Experience Track.
Once you have 3 moves from this playbook, you may pick this playbook's Advanced Move.

If you have 5 moves from this playbook, it's now or never. Make Your Escape immediately. 

_When you Make Your Escape_, 
describe the desperate situation this World orchestrates to interfere with you. 
You and your party should prepare for adversity.

When you make your final push through this situation, Roll with Links.
This roll can't be given Advantage except in the following manner.
If you addressed neither your Obstacle nor Snags, roll with Disadvantage.
If you addressed only the Obstacle or Snags, roll normally.
If you addressed both the Obstacle and Snags, roll with Advantage.

On any Hit: Lose all unlocked Links and moves from this playbook. Then, choose 1:
- You willingly surrender yourself to this World.
  This character becomes a GMPC and the GM takes ownership of their story from now on.
  Deescalate the situation.

- You tear what's left of yourself out of the fabric of this World,
  leaving dangerously frayed edges behind. Escalate the situation.
  Exit the scene immediately. Appear at a location not on this World.
  Regroup later. Take a new playbook that isn't The Connected.

On a 10+: choose 1:
- You haven't (been) let go completely. Take a World Link with this World.
- Recover a lost Link with someone who helped you Make Your Escape.
- Everyone who helped you Make Your Escape marks Experience for each Locked Link they have.
  Then, they may Lock any Unlocked Links they have.

On a 6 or less: You unravel before the World does. You are dead.

* It's Alright, It's Okay *
When you Make Your Escape and successfully leave this World, 
you do not expose the rest of the party to additional danger.

* Look the Other Way *
When you Spend a Link, mark Experience rather than treating the Link as spent. 
This does not apply to effects that say "erase", "lose", "break," or "reset" Links.

* We Can Try To Understand *
Mark Experience to use the Advanced Move Prophecize once. 
If you ever get the chance, you can still take and use Prophecize normally later.

* I Just Can't Lose *
Mark Experience to automatically Roll 10 once.

* Wings of Heaven On My Shoes *
Mark Experience to appear in a scene or to move to any location you choose within the scene you're in.

* Everybody Shaking *
You may mark Experience once to let every PC Make or Change Links with any other PCs they choose.

* Staying Alive *
Mark Experience to completely heal the party's Harm once.

====================
After 3 Advancements, you may take this Move or another Advanced Move
* Feel the City Breaking *
When you Make Your Escape, clear your Experience Track without Advancing in any way.
====================
TO THE PLAYERS AND THE GM
For everyone's peace of mind, MOVES FROM THIS PLAYBOOK AREN'T ELIGIBLE for 
"Pick a Move from another Playbook" Advancement choices. 
The Hightail's moves are intentionally game breaking in a particular way. 
Taking them out of context will only cause heartache. 
If you want to play in this sandbox for a mission, jump all the way in and change your playbook!

Case in point, marking Experience is treated as a cost to be paid by a number of The Hightail's moves. 
This would be ludicrous for any playbook that wasn't about running out of time 
or sawing the branch you're sitting on. This playbook is about both of those things. 
From a narrative perspective, the effects of those moves you're "paying" Experience to get 
represent your character probing the prison walls, so to speak. They're bound to learn something useful 
just by the effort. That's one way to rationalize it, anyway.

That being said, this Playbook is written to ask for the spotlight often, 
but it is also written to play out it's story in a single mission. 
If there is interest in having The Recursion in your game, 
talk with everyone ahead of time and set expectations for the appearance of a "guest star" 
that might turn into a recurring cast member in the future.

The GM needs to be on board with The Recursion joining the game, 
but it doesn't have to be a chore to "work with The GM to establish...". 
This could be an opportunity for the Player choosing The Recursion to do the heavy lifting 
as far as plot hooks for a World or mission go. Consider it a chance for the Player and GM 
to collaborate on something that will engage the other players and encourage their characters 
to want to help The Recursion Make their Escape.

If you're worried about the potential for bad outcomes with The Recursion, remember the following:
The Recursion can Make their Escape before their Experience Track is full.
"It's Alright, It's Okay" preemptively deescalates the situation for the rest of the party after The Recursion escapes. 
"I Just Can't Lose" lets you automatically roll a 10 one time if you mark Experience.
